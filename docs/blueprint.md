## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a muted olive green (#A7BE78) to evoke the natural environment of cattle farming.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) will provide a neutral backdrop that does not distract from the data.
- Accent color: Use a warm, earthy brown (#A0522D) to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) offers a balance of modern and warm aesthetics suitable for both headers and content.
- Employ clear, simple icons sourced from a set like Feather icons to ensure scalability and consistency.
- Adopt a mobile-first design with a clear hierarchy, ensuring elements are easily accessible on smaller screens, and scaling appropriately for larger displays.
- Use subtle transitions and animations, such as a gentle fade for data updates, to improve user engagement without overwhelming the interface.
